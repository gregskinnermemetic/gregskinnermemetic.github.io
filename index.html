        <h1>Welcome to memetic</h1>
        <h2>for a better way to get things done</h2>
        <h3>memetic is a consultancy that specialises in making companies better by improving their delivery systems.</h3>
        <p>We believe that changing the way value gets delivered can be easy, more efficent, and fun.</p>
        <p>In fact, they are our guiding principles for any change effort to be successful:</p>
        <hero>1.</hero>
        <h3>Easy</h3>
        <p>The new way of working must be easier to learn and execute than the way that it is replacing. This could mean less steps, better tooling, better education or a way to better understand why we're doing what we're doing in the first place.</p>
        <hero>2.</hero>
        <h3>Efficient</h3>
        <p>Getting better results for less outlay in effort and time means people and businesses finish the day with more choices available to them, giving them flexibility in increasingly fast-paced and uncertain times</p>
        <hero>3.</hero>
        <h3>Enjoyable</h3>
        <p>Better results happen when a workforce - from senior executives through to the freshest of new hires - find their work rewarding. Enjoyable can mean that we learn as we work, it can mean we're competitive, or it can just mean there's something plain fun about it.</p>
