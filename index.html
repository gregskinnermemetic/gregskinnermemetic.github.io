                <h1>Transform your company by revolutionising execution.</h1>
                <p>Memetic Consulting specialises in making companies better by improving value delivery.</p>
                <p>Our approach is inspired by memetics: great new execution practices self-propagate through a culture.</p>
                <p>When it's done right, your people will make it work for themselves.</p>

            <h2>A memetic approach</h2>
            <p>Successful change should be easy, efficent, and enjoyable.</p>
            <p>That's how we arrived at our principles:</p>
            <div class="explainer-section">
                <div>
                    <h3>Easy</h3>
                    <p>Any new way of working must be easier to learn and execute than the way that it is replacing.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Efficient</h3>
                    <p>Getting better results for less effort means people and businesses finish the day with more choices available, giving flexibility in increasingly fast-paced and uncertain times.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Enjoyable</h3>
                    <p>Better results happen when a workforce - from senior executives through to the freshest of new hires - find their work rewarding.</p>

            <h2>What we do</h1>
            <p>We engage with teams and executives in three ways to ensure that together we really get the best out of how you deliver.</p>

                    <p>We'll work with you to redefine how work gets done so that it minimises waste and maximises across the 'three Es' in our guiding principles.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Collaboration</h3>
                    <p>Working <i>with</i> you, involving you in implementing better approaches means you take a front seat in how the experience we bring is adapted into your world.</p>
                    <p>This means you know your new systems inside out, and can operate your business even better than before.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Capability</h3>

                        <li>training your people</li>
