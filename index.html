                <h1>what?</h1>
                <p>memetic is a consultancy that specialises in making companies better by improving delivery & execution.</p>
                <p>We do this by using any paradigms that are relevant to what the business is trying to achieve: agile, lean, customer centricity, you name it.</p>
                <p>Our approach is inspired by memetics: we beleive that great new execution practices should self-propagate through a culture. When it's done right, people will want to make it work for them.</p>

            <div class="explanation-section">
                <h1>how?</h1>
                <p>We believe that changing the way value gets delivered can be easy, more efficent, and fun.</p>
                <p>In fact, that's how we think change can, and should, be memetic.</p> 
                <p>They are our guiding principles for any change effort to be successful:</p>

                    <h3 class="manifesto-title">Easy</h3>
                    <p>The new way of working must be easier to learn and execute than the way that it is replacing. This could mean less steps, better tooling, better education or a way to better understand why we're doing what we're doing in the first place.</p>
                    <hero class="manifesto-title">2.</hero>
                    <h3 class="manifesto-title">Efficient</h3>
                    <p>Getting better results for less effort means people and businesses finish the day with more choices available to them, giving them flexibility in increasingly fast-paced and uncertain times</p>
                    <hero class="manifesto-title">3.</hero>
                    <h3 class="manifesto-title">Enjoyable</h3>
                    <p>Better results happen when a workforce - from senior executives through to the freshest of new hires - find their work rewarding. Enjoyable can mean that we learn as we work, it can mean we're competitive, or it can just mean there's something plain fun about it.</p>
